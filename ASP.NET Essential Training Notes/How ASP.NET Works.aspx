How ASP.NET Works

All computers in the whole world connect through a protocol TCP-IP

when the computers talk to each other they exchange information by http

A client request in HTTP format for a web resource

>> Web Page
>> Image File
>> CSS, JS File

Server returns a response

Each Client has a Web Browser
	-PC
	-Cell Phones
	-Other Devices

Each Server Runs software called an HTTP Server
IIS - Windows
Apache - All OS

## Retrieving Static Data

Web Client -> HTTP REQ-> Web Server
Web Server -> HTTP RES-> Web Client

## Retrieving & Displaying Data

Web Client <-> Web Server <-> Application Server <-> Database

Application Server talks to the database and other resources
