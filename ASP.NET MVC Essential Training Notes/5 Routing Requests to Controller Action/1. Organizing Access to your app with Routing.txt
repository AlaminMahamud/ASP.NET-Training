Optimizing URLs for Search Engine Optimization
	- Short URLs are better
	- Separate multiple words using dashes(-)
	  instead of underscores(_)
	  Radio_Flyer_Wagon indexes as one word
	  Radio-Flyer-Wagon indexes as three words
	- Stick to lowercase
	  Page1.html and page1.html are treated as different url
