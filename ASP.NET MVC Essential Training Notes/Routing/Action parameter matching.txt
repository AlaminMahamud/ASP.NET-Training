Action parameter matching.txt

Additional URL Parameters other than {controller} and {action}
are available to be passed as arguments to the selected Action Method

The Framework will evaluate the input arguments of the available actions, and match them by name [case-insensitive] to the URL parameters other than {action} and {controller}

With Certain Restrictions the framework will select that action with the greatest number of matching parameters

Some things to consider

	The MVC Framework will first match method arguments by name to URL parameters then it will attempt to match any query string parameters included in the URL by name 

	If the Request is POST, then the framework will attempt to match the contents of the POST body

	Method Arguments are evaluated for a match by name only. The framework does not consider the type required by the method argument

	For Example a URL parametere named {id} with a value of "John" will be considered a match for a method which accepts an int argument named id.

	Action methods can be decorated with attributes which restrict the type of HTTP request they will respond to.

	Such Attribute indicate the applicable HTTP Verb to whihc the action will respond

As an example of limiting the HTTP Actions which a method may respond consider the following


public ActionResult Edit(int id)
{
	return View();
}

[HttpPost]
public ActionResult Edit(int id, FormCollection)
{
	try
	{
	// Add Update Logic Here
		return RedirectToAction("Index");
	}
	catch
	{
		return View();
	}
}

In the above we find two methdos named Edit.

The First accepts an int named id as an argument,

and the second accepts an int named id and a form collection [a complex type]

The purpose of this overloaded method is so that a browser can:
