Modifying the URL Pattern.txt

Route mappings recognize URLs as a pattern of segments separated [or delimited] by a slash[/] character

Each Segment may contain various combinations of literals(text values) and parameter placeholders.

parameters placeholder are identified in a route by a definition by braces

MVC Recognizes the special parameters {controller} and {action} and uses these to locate the appropriate controller and method to call in response to an incoming URL.

Adding A More Restructive Route

public static void RegistgerRoutes(RouteCollection routes)
{
	routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}");


	/// All The Properties 
	/// Rental Properties
	routes.MapRoute
	(
		name 		: "Properties",
		url  		: "RentalProperties/{action}/{id}",
		defaults	: new 
						{
							controller = "RentalProperty",
							action     = "All",
							id    	   = UrlParameter.Optional
						}
	);
 }
