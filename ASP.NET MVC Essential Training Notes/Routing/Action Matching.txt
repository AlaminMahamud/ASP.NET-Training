Action Matching.txt

Once the Framework has selected the proper controller,
it attempts to locate an actionn on the controller with a  name 
matching the {action} parameter value,

The Search for a matching action name is case-insensitive
If more than one action matches by name overloaded methods on the same controller the framework will select the method for which the most URL parameters match arguments by name
