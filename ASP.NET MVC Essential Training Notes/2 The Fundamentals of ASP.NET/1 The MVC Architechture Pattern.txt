The MVC Architechture Pattern

the MVC model

model - view - controller

model -> application busineess logic
	for our site it contains auctions bids user and behaviours

view  -> responsible for interacting with user
	- interacts with user 
	- visualize the model and communicate to the user
	- standard HTML/JavaScript/CSS
	- can render JSON, xml and custom return types

Controller
	acts as a traffic cop

	brains of asp.net

	controls interaction with the layers

	it's real job is to delegate as much as job to the view layers and model layers

	IT generally co ordinate the models and views

Separation of concersn

components are only responsible for one thing
loosely coupled 
modular components
